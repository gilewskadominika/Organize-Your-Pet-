# Organize Your Pet
"Organize Your Pet" is a web application designed to streamline the management of veterinary visits for your beloved pets. 
Developed using Django and hosted on Docker, this application allows users to efficiently add, edit, and delete information related to their animals and profiles. 
Furthermore, users can seamlessly schedule and remove appointments at specific veterinary clinics with designated practitioners.

The application's innovative expansion will include the integration of features for reserving appointments with groomers, 
mirroring the functionality of veterinary visits. Users will also be able to evaluate and provide feedback on both facilities and service providers, 
utilizing a rating system, comments, and reviews.


As a testament to the robustness of the application,
unit tests have been diligently crafted to ensure its reliability and effectiveness. 
This project marks the culmination of my Python Developer course at CodersLab, 
and I am proud to confirm that all the course requirements have been successfully met.
